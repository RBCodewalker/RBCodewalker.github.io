              <p>Hi, nice to meet you. Learn about me and my hobbies. Feel free to take a look around my profile.</p>

                I have a strong enthusiasm for crafting exceptional applications
                that enhances the quality of life for those around me. I really enjoy
                perfecting a design into interactive interface which has been my method of
                working in the past.<br/>
                Besides coding, I love playing video games in my free time. I like
                to travel and go for a hike with my friends if I have a free weekend
                or when I am on a vacation. I also occasionally like cooking.ðŸ™‚
